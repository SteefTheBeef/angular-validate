# Gulangco Plate
Yupp, another AngularJS project boilerplate and build tool!

Gulangco Plate comes prepackaged with [jQuery](http://jquery.com), [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), [AngularStrap](http://mgcrea.github.io/angular-strap), [Angular UI Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) and some good-to-have native angular modules: ngAnimate, ngResource, ngSanitize and ngMock for testing purposes. 

[LESS](http://lesscss.org) and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) is supported out of the box. In fact, this whole project is written in CoffeeScript!

Angular unit testing is available by simply running `gulp test`, there are a few example tests to get you going.
